### What is this repo?

This repo contains all the HTML and CSS files needed for a project where subtitle files are analyzed and children's TV shows are ranked based on how well they would be able to aid in children's vocabulary development. This ranking is determined through analysis of metrics such as words spoken per minute and how often the show introduces "new"/"unusual" words.

### What is in this repo?

The actual python file that wraps the HTML/CSS in Flask is `tv_show_analysis.py`. The HTML files are in the `template` folder, and all the other files such as CSS, images, etc are in the `static`. The required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` determines how the app is run.
